## What is Dapper?

Dapper is an open-source library developed by the team at Stack Overflow. It is often referred to as the "king of micro-ORMs" because it focuses on speed and simplicity while avoiding the heavy abstractions of traditional ORMs like Entity Framework.

## Key Features

1. **High Performance**:  
   - Executes queries efficiently with minimal overhead.
2. **Ease of Use**:  
   - Simplifies data access with extension methods on `IDbConnection`.
3. **Object Mapping**:  
   - Maps database rows to .NET objects with minimal configuration.
4. **Flexibility**:  
   - Supports custom SQL for complex queries.
5. **Cross-Platform**:  
   - Compatible with .NET Framework, .NET Core, and .NET 5+.
6. **Transaction Support**:  
   - Works seamlessly with database transactions.
7. **Parameterized Queries**:  
   - Prevents SQL injection by supporting parameterized queries.
8. **Custom Type Handlers**:  
   - Allows handling of complex or user-defined types.

## How Dapper Works

1. **Database Connection**:  
   - Extends `IDbConnection` with additional methods like `Query` and `Execute`.
2. **Parameterized Queries**:  
   - Execute SQL commands with parameters to avoid SQL injection.
3. **Object Mapping**:  
   - Automatically maps query results to strongly-typed .NET objects.
4. **Multiple Mapping**:  
   - Supports mapping multiple objects in a single query.

## Impact and Challenges

### **Impact**

1. **Performance Efficiency**:  
   - Ideal for scenarios requiring high-speed database interactions.
   
2. **Minimal Learning Curve**:  
   - Simple API for developers familiar with SQL.

3. **Flexibility with SQL**:  
   - Retains control over query structure for advanced scenarios.

### **Challenges**

1. **Limited Abstraction**:  
   - Relies on raw SQL, which may lead to repetitive code.
   
2. **No Schema Management**:  
   - Unlike traditional ORMs, Dapper does not manage database schema or migrations.

---

## Takeaways

- Dapper is a lightweight yet powerful ORM, perfect for developers needing fast and efficient database operations.
- While it lacks advanced features like schema management, its simplicity and performance make it a popular choice.
- Combining Dapper with other tools, such as migrations frameworks, can provide a balanced solution.
